  ### Description
  * For this assignment I created a Professional README Generator using node.js. Users can use thia as a tool to help generate README documents for their projects. The application grenerate a README that meets profestional README guidelines such as Licencing, a Table of Contents, and Contact Information. This README file that you are reading right now is also generated from the application. While working on this assignment I had some minor problems that occured, for example the license badges just did not want to work with me, so that part of the assignment could use some improvement. The Link to the application video is also included at the bottom of the file.
